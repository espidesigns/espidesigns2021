This is the repository of [espidesigns//2021](https://www.espidesigns.com/) forked from [Bizarro](http://bizar.ro/) portfolio. 

# Overview

The front end of the portfolio was made entirely with plain JavaScript code using ECMAScript 2015+ features without any frameworks like Angular, React or Vue. It's using libraries such as [GSAP](https://greensock.com/), [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) and [ogl](https://github.com/oframe/ogl). To generate our static files that will be uploaded to the environment, we're using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

# Getting Started

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed in your machine, these are our only dependencies to run the project locally.
